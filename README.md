# denoising_neuralnets
An attempt to create a Neural Network to Remove Various Types of Noises From a given Image.  
Initially all the pictures on which the model is trained are from MNIST dataset.  
Project is implemented in Tensorflow.  


### noise_removal_CAE.ipynb  
CAE stands for Convolutional Auto-Encoder.   
Type of Noise Introduced: Salt and Pepper  
Intensity of the noise can be changed within the code.
